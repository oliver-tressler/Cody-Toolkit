# Cody Toolkit (Plugin Management)

Cody Toolkit allows performing various tasks that are frequent when customizing Dynamics CRM 2016 directly in VS Code via VS Code Extensions.
Each extension provides tools to simplify a different area of the development and customization workflows.

-   **Build & Publish**: With this extension, developing TypeScript and JavaScript WebResources for the CRM will be a lot smoother. It handles the building, bundling, minifying and publishing for you. However, this is not limited to scripts. You can create new WebResources from Images, HTML Pages and CSS Files.
-   **Solution Management**: Create new solutions without leaving your code editor. Easily add WebResources, Assemblies and Steps to them... With a proper search filter... Looking at you Microsoft... (ಠ_ಠ)
-   **Proxy Generation**: Working with entities and actions in frontend code is tedious. Generate TypeScript proxies that work both in Form and standalone WebResource environments.
-   **Plugin Browser (Alpha)**: Browse your assemblies, plugins, steps and images. Add new ones, or edit existing ones.

To find out more about each extension, please have a look at their designated `README` files.
